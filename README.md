# SFML-One

### The purpose of this repo is to allow anyone to jump into SFML *with* CMake and play around a little. I also wanted to do this for myself obviously so it's just as finished as I need it to be for my purposes. Feel free to take this and run with it! My SFML Fork is just set to build SFML as a static project for your own personal use cases!
##### Enjoy!
