# SFML-CMake-Starter

### The purpose of this repo is to allow anyone to jump into SFML *with* CMake and play around a little. I also wanted to do this for myself obviously so it's just as finished as I need it to be for my purposes. Feel free to take this and run with it! My SFML Fork is just set to build SFML as a static project for your own personal use cases!

### This Project started as a repo to follow along with [Suraj Sharma](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6xSOsbVA1eb_QqMTTcql_3PdOiE928up) with the simple addition of CMake. Now that I'm at the end of that tutorial series the repo is growing to host each of the game samples I make through my studies. Keeping them in the same repo on seperate branches allows me to cherry pick each feature added but comes with its own headaches.

##### Enjoy!
